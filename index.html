    <div id="Bio">
      <p>I'm a random human out of over 7 billion on planet Earth. I got into coding because 1) I joined my high school's robotics team and they needed more coders and 2) I wanted to program cool video games like those of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Likes:</strong> Pretty art (especially by the talented <a href="https://deviantart.com/yuumei/gallery">Yuumei</a>) and cool bits of technology that you can make at home (like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw">VR equipment that you can make using a Wii Remote</a>).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Plagiarism. Taking credit for others' work is not cool. </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dreams for the future:</strong> To get a decent job that will make my parents happy, and then take a super long vacation during which I'll visit the beautiful and historic places of the world.

        <h2>Favorite Websites:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>: I love making Scratch projects and browsing the projects that other Scratchers have made!</li>
          <li><a href="https://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>: Because I'm a degenerate who wastes way too much time looking at random internet posts instead of studying.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/">Deviantart</a>: I really enjoy looking at the beautiful pieces of art that others have made, and actively try to improve my own art in the hopes that, someday, I too can paint with the same level of skill.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Penguin Pics:</h1> <button id="show/hide-Penguins" onclick="showHideSection('Penguins')">Hide Penguins</button>
    <div id="Penguins">
      <p>In case it wasn't already obvious, my favorite animal is the cute and cuddly penguin. Enjoy the pics!</p>
